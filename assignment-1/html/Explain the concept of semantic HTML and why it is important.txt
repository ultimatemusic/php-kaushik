What is Semantic HTML?
    1)   
        Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning about
        the structure and content of a webpage, rather than just defining presentation. 
        These elements describe the purpose of the content, making it more understandable for 
        both browsers and developers.

Why is Semantic HTML Important?
    1) Accessibility:
        Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on semantic markup to interpret and navigate 
        content properly.
        Helps users with disabilities understand the page structure.
    
    2) SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
        Search engines prioritize well-structured content, improving rankings.
        Semantic tags help crawlers identify key sections (e.g., <article> for blog posts).
    
    3) Maintainability & Readability:
        Makes code easier to understand for developers.
        Encourages consistent structure across projects.
    
    4) Future-Proofing:
        Ensures compatibility with evolving web standards and technologies.
        Reduces reliance on non-semantic <div> and <span> tags.

    5) Better Styling & Responsiveness:
        Provides meaningful hooks for CSS and JavaScript.
        Helps in creating responsive designs by logically grouping content.
