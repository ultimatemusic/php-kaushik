1:Describe the purpose of HTML tags.
    HTML tags are the foundation of web page structure
    acting as instructions to browsers on how to display content. 
    They define elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, providing organization and meaning to web pages. 
    Essentially, they tell the browser what something is, and how it should be presented visually.
