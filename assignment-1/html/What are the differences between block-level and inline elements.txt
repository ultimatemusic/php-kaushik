1: Block-Level Elements

Definition:  
          Block-level elements occupy the full width available and start on a new line.
          They often contain other block-level or inline elements.

Characteristics:
    - Always start on a new line.
    - Take up the full width of their container (by default).
    - Can contain both inline and other block-level elements.
    - Useful for structuring the layout of a webpage.

Common Examples:
    - `<div>` – generic container
    - `<p>` – paragraph
    - `<h1>` to `<h6>` – headings
    - `<ul>` / `<ol>` – unordered/ordered lists
    - `<li>` – list items
    - `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` – semantic layout elements

2: Inline Elements

Definition:  
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
    They are typically used to style parts of text.

Characteristics:
    - Do not start on a new line.
    - Only occupy space needed by their content.
    - Can only contain other inline elements or text.
    - Useful for formatting text inside block-level elements.

Common Examples:
    - `<span>` – generic inline container
    - `<a>` – anchor (link)
    - `<strong>` – bold text
    - `<em>` – italicized text
    - `<img>` – image
    - `<br>` – line break (technically an inline-level tag that forces a break)

Example to Illustrate:

      html
      <div>
        <p>This is a block-level paragraph.</p>
        <p>This <strong>word</strong> is bold using an inline element.</p>
      </div>
      

      - <div> and <p> are block-level (they stack vertically).
      - <strong> is inline (used inside the paragraph, doesn’t break layout).
