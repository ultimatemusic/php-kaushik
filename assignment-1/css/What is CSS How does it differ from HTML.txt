What is CSS?:
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
    is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. 
    It defines how HTML elements should be displayed, including colors, fonts, spacing, 
    positioning, and responsiveness.

How HTML and CSS Work Together:
    HTML provides the structure (e.g., a heading, paragraph, or button).
    CSS enhances the design (e.g., makes the heading red, adds a background, or animates the button).

Why Use CSS Instead of Styling in HTML?:
    Separation of Concerns – Keeps structure (HTML) and design (CSS) separate for cleaner code.
    Reusability – One CSS file can style multiple HTML pages.
    Efficiency – Changes (e.g., font size) apply globally, not per element.
    Advanced Control – Enables animations, responsive layouts (Flexbox/Grid), and themes.

Conclusion
    HTML = Skeleton (content & structure).
    CSS = Skin & clothes (visual styling).
    Together, they create well-structured, visually appealing websites
